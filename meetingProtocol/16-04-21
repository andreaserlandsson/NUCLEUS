MeetingAgenda

  Date: 16-04-21

  Facilitator: Erik Jansson 

  Participants: Herman Carlström, Andreas Erlandsson, Miranda Bånnsgård

1. Objectives (5 min). Resolve any issues preventing the team to 
  continue.

  - Briefing
  - View and controller and class structure
  - Issue listing

2. Reports (15 min) from previous meeting

  - Briefing
  - Progress on UML
  - Basic skeletal class structure somewhat done
  - RAD and use cases have been refined

3. Discussion items (35 min) 

  - Collision handler:
    > Connects to level.
    > Nucleon and gluon should extend a Vector class. This allows the collision checker to check between types Nucleon and GluonPoint even though they are
      different types

  - Input controller:
    > One input controller to molecule
    > Menu controller and level controller (which will pause and bring up pause menu?)(which are later problems)

  - Level size/coordinate system:
    > Needs to be fixed so the vectors can "relate to something".

  - Interfaces for mocking:
    > Interfaces should be made to allow for easier testing (dependency injection). Also to allow for polymorphism

  - Later issue: allow differing screen sizes and aspect ratios


4. Outcomes and assignments (5 min) 

  - Miranda makes CollisionHandler which takes classes that extend Vector
  - Erik makes Vector class and integrates with Nucleon and Proton. Looks inte Level size/coordinate system and testing.
  - Herman finishes LevelBuilder and creates interfaces for models.
  - Andreas looks into NucleonCannon

5. Wrap up

  - See 4.
