MeetingAgenda

  Date: 160414
  Facilitator: Herman Carlström

  Participants: Andreas Erlandsson, Erik Jansson, Miranda Bånnsgård, Hannes Lagerroth

1. Objectives (5 min). Resolve any issues preventing the team to 
  continue.

  - We are welcoming Hannes in to the group! He has been briefed on the project and has already developed a good understanding of the tasks involved.

  - Slight re-definition of the domain-model and Use-cases.

  
2. Reports (15 min) from previous meeting

  - The work with the two models have functioned great, and just need to be polished until Monday.
  - Game rulez have been finalized and everyone (Hannes included) clearly understand the game objectives.
  - Been OK'ed from supervisor regarding use-cases, domain-model and the overall contents of the RAD.

3. Discussion items (35 min) 

  - As soon as we have corrected the issues from last week (see point 2) we will begin the programming. We have set up a trello for the group to be able to administrate objectives and tasks to each group member efficiently. As we now are five(5) people the communication will be slightly more difficult. 
  - Discussed new features to implement into the model(and possibly the project) as we now are five(5) people, instead of four(4). Possible additions are; leaderbord, awards and achievements, different setting options, GAMMA and BETA particles (see RAD).
  - Discussed the modularity of different objects (highscore, saving, levels etc.)

4. Outcomes and assignments (5 min) 
  - Look up dependency-injection.
  - Finish the two models until monday.
  - Polish the use-cases we have.
  - Set up the programming environment (LIBGDX into android-studio's).

5. Wrap up
  - Unresolved issues: Do our use-cases cover our entire idea? 
  - Time for next meeting: 160418 14:00
